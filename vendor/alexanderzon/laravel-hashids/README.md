# Hashids for Laravel 5

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/alexanderzon/laravel-hashids/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/alexanderzon/laravel-hashids) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/alexanderzon/laravel-hashids/downloads.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/alexanderzon/laravel-hashids)

This package uses the classes created by [hashids.org](http://www.hashids.org/ "http://www.hashids.org/")

Generate hashes from numbers, like YouTube or Bitly. Use hashids when you do not want to expose your database ids to the user.

----------

## Installation

- [Hashids on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/alexanderzon/laravel-hashids)
- [Hashids on GitHub](https://github.com/alexanderzon/laravel-hashids)
- [Laravel 4 Installation](#user-content-laravel-4-installation)

To get the latest version of Hashids simply require it in your `composer.json` file.

~~~
"alexanderzon/laravel-hashids": "dev-master"
~~~

You'll then need to run `composer install` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

Once Hashids is installed you need to register the service provider with the application. Open up `config/app.php` and find the `providers` key.


```php
'AlexanderZon\Hashids\HashidsServiceProvider'
```

> There is no need to add the Facade, the package will add it for you.


### Publish the configurations

Run this on the command line from the root of your project:

~~~
$ php artisan config:publish alexanderzon/laravel-hashids
~~~

A configuration file will be publish to `config/laravel-hashids.php`.


## Laravel 4 Installation

Add verison 1.0 of Hashids in your `composer.json` file.

~~~
"alexanderzon/laravel-hashids": "3.0.*"
~~~

And following the directions in the [README](https://github.com/AlexanderZon/laravel-hashids/tree/1.0.0) on version 1.0.

## Usage

Once you've followed all the steps and completed the installation you can use Hashids.

### Encodeing

You can simply encode a single id:

```php
Hashids::encode(1); // Returns Ri7Bi
```

or multiple..

```php
Hashids::encode(1, 21, 12, 12, 666); // Returns MMtaUpSGhdA
```

### Decodeing

```php
Hashids::decode(Ri7Bi);

// Returns
int 1
```

or multiple..

```php
Hashids::decode(MMtaUpSGhdA);

// Returns
array (size=5)
0 => int 1
1 => int 21
2 => int 12
3 => int 12
4 => int 666
```

## Changelog

**2.0.0**

- Upgraded to Laravel 5
- Upgraded to Hashids 1.0.5

**1.0.0**

- Several public functions are renamed to be more appropriate:
	- Function `encrypt()` changed to `encode()`
	- Function `decrypt()` changed to `decode()`
	- Function `encryptHex()` changed to `encodeHex()`
	- Function `decryptHex()` changed to `decodeHex()`

	Hashids was designed to encode integers, primary ids at most. Hashids is the wrong algorithm to encrypt sensitive data. So to encourage more appropriate use, `encrypt/decrypt` is being "downgraded" to `encode/decode`.

- Version tag added: `1.0`
- `README.md` updated
